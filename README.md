#Car-Dealership DataBase Project - JDBC/DataGrip connection with UI

This is my car dealership - database course project made with Java/DB2 - a console application that lets the user access and modify the database easily. The database contains information about car dealerships, staff, clients and all the vehicles that can be bought.
